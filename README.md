## Features 

In the first demonstrative version, minimum features and their elements have been disclosed in order to create a rich experience for users over longer periods of time. Also, for legal protection and initial attention from investors, a large amount of information has been summarized to cover main topics and categories before planned full disclosure. Meaning all of our aspects will be expanded shortly, proffesional media uploaded and final legally protected branding released. We will continue to improve consistently while strategically releasing new content and features according to our planned agenda and current state of users. This site is made fully responsive across variety of devices with lowest guaranteed working width of 360px and height of 640px taking older cellular models into consideration in order to establish global presence.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Navigation bar is set at the top of the page. However, when the game mode starts, it gets removed until users decides to start again and lands back here from any of the results screens: winning, losing and folded
  - Navigation bar provides user with identication that it is correct game next to shortcuts of accessing desired sections of the page
  - Navigation bar is intuitive and all types of users can navigate to desired section without needing any further explanation
  - The main title is written in coral color standing out with largest font-size. It takes user back to the same page but refreshed
  - The menu bar to the right of the game title is directing users to the main four categories of the page: Rules, Game, Feedback and Contact. On the larger screens, menu is shown next to the main title, while for tablet and phone sizes of screen, is is located under the title stretching across the screen  
  
    ![Home Page](./assets/media/images/home.jpg)

- __Cover Media__

  - The landing cover media includes a professional custom-made logo that is also used as a current tab icon. There is the main mascotte of the brand, Sharky above the title of the game. Logo has been made considering all ages
  - This section introduces the user to Bigger Fish page with an eye-catching sharp and creative animation of logo increasing size from the dot to full size. This will grab users' attention and increase the chances for a great first impression
  - Without exensive text introduction requiering serious participation, image relaxes the user with smooth light-skyblue colors smoothly guiding over to the next section that discloses the rules. Instead first reading, then relaxing, we wanted user to built up the energy instead dropping it before the game due to too many textual distractions

    ![Header Cover Image](./assets/media/images/home.jpg)

- __Rules__

  - Once users' attention is captured from landing elements, highly important and summarized information how to play game is given to process
  - Full game rules have been disclosed in this section assuring smooth gameplay for user and answering any potential general questions proactively
  - Following the bright coral-style and reef-style visuals and captivating background of shallow water, user is provided with text blocks that have the effect of being overtaken by algae after spent long time sitting in the water. This tells user that rules are always consistent and remained this way for long time already. Again, main colors of green, coral and gray are utilitized to achieve the contrastual purpose and visual categorization. Overal design is made for all ages implementing playful yet informative rules section

    ![Rules](./assets/media/images/rules.jpg)

- __Insert Coin__

  - This section serves the purpose of being the bridge that leads user to the actual game screen from home page.
  - There is an animation where after user presses the insert lifecoin button, a 3D logo of coin appears and animates being placed inside a window on megalithic temple. Shortly after the animation start, small earthquake trembling sound effect starts
  - Once trembling is done, entire screen is wiped clean and transferred to Video Intro section
  - Having elements of image animation and button click arcade sound effects for youth, cryptocurrency coin for adults and meghalitic segment for older generation and history lovers, this section is also made to satisfy criteria of possible usage for any type of user no matter their age or favourite knowledge topics

    ![Insert Coin Static](./assets/media/images/insert-coin.jpg)

    ![Insert Coin Response](./assets/media/images/insert-two.jpg)

- __Feedback Form__

  - The feedback form will allow the users to enter the second level of participation. First one is obviously to play the game and communication with social media. With this form, player is engaged to share his opions and criticism, next to even more important ideas generation. This way user is provided with option to construct on top of the original game without limitation and this way to become the game. As well, there are benefits to customize game from life experiences based on personal preferences or past without or with othe player's participation
  - By completing this short online form, users' personal information of name and email is presented in order to being able to contact them back with a response and address them properly. Location is requiered in order to know to which regional server of the game user belongs to so their request can be forwarded to the correct regional office and team. Also allows multi-langual support
  - Feedback form has been designed to fit every user with white sheet representing a piece of paper which is general global way of reading. All segments have been separated and categorized with subtle coloring of main website colors: coral, gray and green
  There is a sand in the background representing the point of view that user is standing on the beach reading or writing feedback form. This is very important and creates subliminal experience and deeper connection between all home page and gaming sections. The reason is that looking from bottom towards up, footer with gray color represents a road and coral line on copyright envisions fence or separation between road and grass. Grass is represented with green social media icons which are usually the small green pathes of grass on majority of beaches at the entrance. The next layer or level in constructing this site was our beach sand and feeback form that guides user to another green part which can be a beach park or beach towel with meghalitic ruins that launch the game. If users wish to know if "there are fishes in the waters", they need to go to the shallows and read the rules box. Above rules box and shallow water, there is cover media with light-skyblue background representing the sky and the navigation bar in user imagination would be a big fixed box in the sky. Once users explores the "beach area" they can interact with inserting lifecoin that takes them to all gaming segments with hints on deep waters. Therefore, feedback form is the key to separating game mode from home screen mode and creating specific atmosphere based on current status

- __Footer__

  - The footer section includes links to the selected few social media sites for Bigger Fish. There is also copyright section and version control. Footer is broken down visually into those three parts, all made up of the main site's colors green, coral and dark gray
  - The social media links from icons will open into a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and to keep our site always open. This project's first version is for demonstrative purposes and links for now guide to the general sites, not our main social media accounts since they are being built under the actual name that will be copyrighted and branded. Footer is very important to the users because it also gives further options to visit that expand to other widely used sites, connect with the Team, and even directly contact with any requests or problems 
  - Copyright segment offers direct information of copyrighted status of the game and the year
  - Third and final part is the version control for users familiar with the development's team products and services. Here is where user can find out instantly which version they are using with accompanying release date. Next row discloses to users who is the parent brand or sponsor that is powering Bigger Fish website and team. And finally at the bottom there is a README link to the Bigger Fish README for all users unfamiliar with GitHub. This is extremely useful because users can see what is the full concept and partial development behind their favourite game. Eventually, this will lead us to offer packages to users with percentages of full code and/or knowledge sharing and disclosure of our products and services
